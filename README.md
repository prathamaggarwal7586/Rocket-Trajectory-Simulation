This program simulates the trajectory of a rocket launched from the surface
of a planet. It prompts the user to input the name of the planet, the initial
velocity of the rocket, and the launch angle. Using this input, the program
calculates the trajectory of the rocket, considering the gravitational force exerted by the chosen planet. The trajectory calculation involves simulating the
rocket’s motion over time, accounting for changes in velocity and position due to
gravitational attraction. After computing the trajectory, the program analyzes
its shape to determine whether it’s elliptical, hyperbolic, circular, or parabolic.
Finally, the program visualizes the rocket’s trajectory using matplotlib, displaying a plot that includes the trajectory path, the planet’s position, and the final
position of the rocket. Through this simulation, users can explore how different
launch parameters affect the path of the rocket and gain insights into orbital
mechanics and gravitational interactions.
